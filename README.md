File handling is an essential aspect of programming, and Python provides built-in functions to interact with files. In this guide, we will explore how to use Python's open function to work with text files (“txt” files).

# Reading Text Files
Reading text files involves extracting and processing the data stored within them. Text files can have various structures, and how you read them depends on their format. 

# Writing to a file
You can create a new text file and write data to it using Python's open() function. The open() function takes two main arguments: the file path (including the file name) and the mode parameter, which specifies the operation you want to perform on the file.


# File modes in Python (syntax and use cases)
The following table provides an overview of different file modes, their syntax, and common use cases. Understanding these modes is essential when working with files in Python for various data manipulation tasks.
